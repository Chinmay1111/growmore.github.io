		<h1>How Dell Technologies is helping partners with a Digital First approach</h1>
		<p>Ever since March of 2020, the business world has had to adapt to an entirely new paradigm for conducting day-to-day operations.  Every enterprise in every industry has had to adjust from the normal course of doing business with an in-person touch, to one of a digital dynamic.<br/>
 
        Dell Technologies and their partners were not spared from having to employ this new virtual model. Both have had to adapt new ways in which to engage with customers, identify new buyers, and access new prospects to fill the sales funnel - all online. By all indications this trend is poised to continue, as buyers are making decisions through self-education gleaned from digital and other online channels.<br/>
 
        Another trend that we see no retreat from is the ‘Consumerization’ of IT. Now more than ever, Solution Providers need to create an online, robust experience for their customers and prospects. They need to read buyers’ digital body language and meet customers where they are – online. By leaning into these technologies to provide a personalized buying experience the likelihood of building a one-to one marketing relationship is greatly increased.<br/><br/> </p>
	</div>

	<div class="businesstitle">
		<h1>Paving the way for Solution Providers with modern tools and techniques</h1>
		<p>Dell Technologies is providing partners with access to resources and skills development to help them not only survive but thrive in this new paradigm. Dell understands that partners have the expertise and know-how to help shared customers drive digital transformation. As such, Dell has gone to great lengths to empower and enable them to adapt to these new selling and marketing techniques more easily, so that partners can in turn focus on what they do best.<br/><br/>

		Dell’s Partner Portal provides partners with the digital marketing and selling tools, training, and content to meet their buyers where they are – online.<br/><br/></p>
